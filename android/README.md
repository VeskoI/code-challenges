# Summary

My simple solution to the Android code challenge. Far from perfect, but written well within the required time bounds.

## Challenge
Code an Android application that displays information received over the network.

### Details

The server at the following url responds with JSON formatted data:

```(GET) http://guidebook.com/service/v2/upcomingGuides/```

The response represents a list of “Guide” objects:

```json
{
  "data": [
  {
    "startDate": "<date>",
    "endDate": "<date>",
    "name": "<name>",
    "url": "<url>",
    "venue": {"city": "<city>", "state": "<state>"},
    "icon": "<url to png image>"
    },
    … <more objects>
    ]
  }
  ```

### Steps
  
Try to complete as many of these steps as possible. Within 1 hour, have a working version of your project ready to demonstrate the steps you have completed.

1. Retrieve and print out (to Logcat) the data received from the url above.

2. Parse the data retrieved from the server into a list of Java objects

3. Display your objects in an organized fashion (ListView, GridView, etc.)
  - Only worry about displaying the name for this step

4. In addition the object’s name, have your view display the image located at each object’s icon url.
